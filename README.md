👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m Elevated Code, a passionate frontend developer who loves turning ideas into reality using clean and efficient tools. I’m currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering where I’m also diving deep into networking as a Network Plus + 

But my passion doesn't stop at code — I'm also a Design Professional at Canva**, where I craft stunning, user-friendly visuals that bring digital content to life. I’ve created hundreds of impactful graphics and templates using Canva, Adobe tools, and more.

As a global speaker by 2030 I’ve had the opportunity to share my voice and inspire young creators around the world. I also author The Elevation Hub**, where I write about creativity, tech, and digital empowerment.
